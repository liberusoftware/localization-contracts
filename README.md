## Scope

Stable provider-neutral machine translation contracts for Liberu Localization. This package is independently versioned and has no application-specific dependency.

## Requirements and installation

| Dependency | Supported version |
|---|---|
| `php` | `^8.5` |

```bash
composer require liberusoftware/localization-contracts
```

## Public surface

- `src/TranslationProvider.php`
- `src/TranslationProviderRegistry.php`

Consumers should depend only on these public types and Composer metadata. Semantic-versioning rules apply to changes in their signatures or behaviour.

## Testing

Run the package tests through a compatible host checkout and verify Composer installation on PHP 8.5. Contract packages must remain free of framework, persistence, UI, and provider-SDK concerns; the installer must retain deterministic, traversal-safe install/update/remove behaviour.

## Security

Do not report vulnerabilities through public issues. Email `security@liberusoftware.com` with reproduction details and the affected version.

## License

This package is open-source software under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md). The linked licence text is authoritative.

## Feedback and contributing

Focused issues and tested pull requests are welcome in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/liberusoftware/localization-contracts). Update tests, documentation, and `CHANGELOG.md` for user-visible changes.
